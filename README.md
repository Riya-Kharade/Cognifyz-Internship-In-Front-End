#Cognifyz Internship Experience<br>
Name: Riya Kharade<br>
Domain: Front-End Development<br>

I joined the Cognifyz internship to gain practical experience in front-end development. During the internship, I was assigned several tasks, which I completed with dedication and effort.<br>
As per the internship process, there were two payment options for moving forward:<br>
Pay Rs. 149 to receive the certificate of completion without participating in the interview process.<br>
Pay a higher amount (around Rs. 250, though I’m not certain of the exact amount) to proceed to the interview stage as well.<br>
I decided to pay Rs. 149 and opted out of the interview process, as my primary goal was to obtain the certificate. However, despite completing 8–10 tasks successfully, I have still not received my certificate.

I am uploading my completed tasks here as a record of my efforts and dedication. This provides me with a sense of satisfaction, knowing I worked hard and completed the internship tasks to the best of my ability.
